# Iâ€™m Joe, a Front-End Web Developer

My passion for web development has always been present. I am excited by building sites that are accessible, SEO friendly and fast. To do this I use a variety of tools such as WordPress, Gatsby, React, Vue, and other frameworks. Despite using many current frameworks, I have a strong grounding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whilst developing sites I have gained experience with CI/CD chains and a variety of hosting platforms such as Digital Ocean, Netlify, Firebase, and Cloudflare. I have been following the continuous growth of technologies such as PWAs and the Jamstack. I'm currently freelancing whilst studying at Southampton Solent University.
